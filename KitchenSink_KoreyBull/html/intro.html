<body><h2>Introduction to the Kitchen Sink</h2><p>"This is the Kitchen Sink sample.  It demonstrates many of the widgets in the Qt framework."</p><p>"This sample also demonstrates something else really  useful in GWT: history support.  When you click on a tab, the location bar will be updated with the current <i>history token</i>, which keeps the app in a bookmarkable state.  The back and forward buttons work properly as well.  Finally, notice that you can right-click a tab and 'open in new window'."</p><p></p></body>
