<h2>Basic and Rich Text</h2>
<p>
  "GWT includes the standard complement of text-entry widgets, each of which supports keyboard and selection events you can use to control text entry.  In particular, notice that the selection range for each widget is updated whenever you press a key."

  "Also notice the rich-text area to the right.  This is supported on all major browsers, and will fall back gracefully to the level of functionality supported on each."
