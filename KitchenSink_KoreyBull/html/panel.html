<body><h2>Panels</h2><p>This page demonstrates some of the basic GWT panels, each of which arranges its contained widgets differently.  These panels are designed to take advantage of the browser's built-in layout mechanics, which keeps the user interface snappy and helps your AJAX code play nicely with existing HTML.  On the other hand, if you need pixel-perfect control, you can tweak things at a low level using the   <code>DOM</code>   class.</p></body>
