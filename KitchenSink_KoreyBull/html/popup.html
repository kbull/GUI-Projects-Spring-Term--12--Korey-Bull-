<body><h2>Popups and Dialog Boxes</h2><p>"This page demonstrates GWT's built-in support for in-page popups.  The first is a very simple informational popup that closes itself automatically when you click off of it.  The second is a more complex draggable dialog box.  If you're wondering why there's a list box at the bottom, it's to demonstrate that you can drag the dialog box over it (this obscure corner case often renders iconrrectly on some browsers)."</p></body>
